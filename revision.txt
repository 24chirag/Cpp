encapsulation ->the process of grouping together the properties and method in a single unit is called encapsulation
how to achive encapsulation->by using class and structure(very less people know )
->the member of structure is public 
->the member of class is private 

->encapsulation is nothing just data hiding + abstraction(implementation doesnt show to user)

WHAT IS DATA HIDING ?
using access specifers we are restricting the data outside the class cant be accessed directly.
HIDING THE DATA BEHIND METHODS ->PROCESS KNOW AS DATA HIDING 

WHAT IS ABSTRACTION->hiding implementation details which is not needed 
WHAT IS INLINE FUNCTION->using keyword inline programmer give responsibility to compilier that function need to be expand or not ->purpose of inline function is OPTIMISATION

WHAT IS DEFAULT ARGUMENT-> in general if we declare a function with 2 parameter then it is not possible to call function with greater than 2 or less 2 parameters
for running 2 para + 3 para we used default argument
ALL DEFAULT ARGUMENT SHOULD BE RIGHT ALIGNED IN A FUNCTION SIGNATURE.

WHAT IS FUNCTION OVERLOADING ?
SIGNATURE IS DIFFERENT ->FUNCTION IS DIFFERENT ->RETURN TYPE IS NOT ADDED IN SIGNATURE

WHAT IS OVERLOAD RESOLUTION?
AT COMPILE TIME WHEN FUNCTION CALL IS MADE TOO SO MANY OVERLOADED FUNCTION ...SO DETERMINE WHICH FUNCTION CALL IS INVOKED IS OVERLOAD RESOLUTION

HOW OVERLOAD RESOLUTION DONE?
->FIRST EXACT MATCH 
->TYPE PROMOTION->CHARACTER PROMOTED TO INTEGER AND FLOAT TO DOUBLE
->TYPE CONVERSION


CLASS AND OBJECT 
CLASS IS AN DISCRIPTION OF AN OBJECT 
NO MEMORY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED 
CLASS IS A KEYWORD 
CLASS IS A BLUEPRINT
HOW OBJECT LOOKS ALIKE DECIDE IN CLASS 

OBJECT IS A PHSICAL EXSITENCE OF CLASS
