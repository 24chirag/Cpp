# C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++**. It explains the core principles and concepts of OOP, including Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction, and demonstrates how they are applied in real-world programming.

## OOP Concepts

### 1. Classes & Objects
- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects.  
- **Object:** An instance of a class representing real-world entities.  
- **Purpose:** Encapsulates data and behavior together.

### 2. Encapsulation
- **Definition:** Restricting direct access to data members of a class.  
- **Implementation:** Using private/protected members with public getter and setter methods.  
- **Benefit:** Improves security and maintains data integrity.

### 3. Inheritance
- **Definition:** Mechanism to derive a new class (child) from an existing class (parent).  
- **Types:** Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical.  
- **Benefit:** Promotes code reusability and logical hierarchy.

### 4. Polymorphism
- **Definition:** Ability of a function or object to take multiple forms.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Compile-time (Static):** Function overloading and operator overloading.  
  - **Run-time (Dynamic):** Virtual functions and method overriding.  
- **Benefit:** Allows flexible and extensible code design.

### 5. Abstraction
- **Definition:** Hiding implementation details while exposing essential features.  
- **Implementation:** Using abstract classes and pure virtual functions.  
- **Benefit:** Simplifies complex systems and enhances modularity.

## Applications
- Game development (e.g., character classes, object interactions)  
- GUI frameworks (widgets, windows, buttons)  
- Simulation systems (vehicles, banking systems)  
- Software design patterns (singleton, factory, observer)

- Understand and implement core OOP principles in C++.  
- Design robust and reusable C++ programs.  
- Apply OOP concepts to real-world problems efficiently.
